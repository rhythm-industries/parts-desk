"This isn’t a fire sale.
This isn’t “make me move.”
This is offering good things to good hands.
Things that have served me well — and now want to keep serving, elsewhere."

🏠 SV (South 5th Residence):
Not just a property. It was a sanctuary. A studio. A container for becoming.
Now: it’s ready for someone who feels the spirit of that space and will live into it.

🚙 S2000:
Precision. Lightness. A machine built with intent.
You’re not parting with it because you don’t care — you’re making room. Letting someone else fall in love.

🏘️ Segovia Pad:
It was a hopeful hold. It taught you lessons. It helped you see what “good ownership” really means.
Now it's someone else’s turn to take it further.
