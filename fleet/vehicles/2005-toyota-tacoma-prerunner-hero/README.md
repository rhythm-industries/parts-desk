## What this document is

This README is a factual, personal record of a 2005 Toyota Tacoma
that has been owned, maintained, and used with long-term stewardship
in mind.

It is not a marketing listing.
It is not a restoration showcase.
It is not a claim of perfection.

It exists to reduce uncertainty for the next steward.

## Stewardship approach

This Tacoma was maintained with a bias toward:

- mechanical reliability over cosmetics
- reversible modifications
- known failure prevention
- honest acknowledgment of wear

Nothing was done for resale value.
Everything was done for usability and longevity.

## Known unknowns / notes

- This is a 20-year-old vehicle; age-related wear exists.
- Some cosmetic imperfections remain untreated by choice.
- I can describe maintenance decisions, not every prior owner’s intent.

## Ownership context

Included is a snapshot from my personal vehicle history log.
It provides context on how long vehicles tend to remain under my care.

The Tacoma is one of the longest-held vehicles in this record.

## Specifications

A factual specification reference (engine, drivetrain, dimensions,
capacities) is provided in a separate document:

This truck will outlast 99% of what you see on the road. I've had it 10+ years and it's proven to have bulletproof reliability. Includes towing package, Pioneer Bluetooth radio, aftermarket bronze alloy wheels with upsized tires

Reliable. Quietly noble. It carried weight without complaint.  
Now it gets to be someone else’s loyal companion.
