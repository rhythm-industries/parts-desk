# Archive Context

This repository is maintained as a factual stewardship record
for a long-held personal vehicle.

Principles:

- completeness over marketing
- clear separation of specs, state, and narrative
- archival accuracy over sales optimization
- minimal files, maximal clarity

Documents are written to reduce uncertainty for a future steward,
not to persuade a buyer or optimize for search.
