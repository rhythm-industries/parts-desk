# Registry

This folder contains a markdown-based export of the Registry
(originally the `Inventory` tab in Fleet Mgmt).

Purpose:
- Preserve completeness of source data
- Enable LLM-assisted querying and auditing
- Maintain stewardship framing (not stock / warehouse semantics)

Files:
- `registry.md` — complete tab export as a markdown table

Notes:
- Empty cells preserved as empty
- Text values minimally escaped for markdown safety
